# Rubik-Cube

OpenGL exercise to render a Rubik's Cube and solves a scrambled version.

I am aware that many such online Rubik's Cube solvers exist elsewhere. Inspiration for this project is from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM2czqavlWM by Code Bullet. I did not view Code Bullet's source code aside from the brief moments shown in the video.

Starter code is fully attributed to Professor Etienne Vouga.

To run in Ubuntu, 
1. `rm -r build`
2. `mkdir build`
3. `./run.sh`
