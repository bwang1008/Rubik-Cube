v Implement camera rotation around a center
v Design Rubik's Cube's vertices, faces graphically
v Render Cube
v Color faces
v Make inside cube faces black
v Implement turns
v Implement quarter turns
v Implement stopping quarter turns and move onto next move
v Ensure face colors are preserved after all quarter turns
- Double check all possible turns are correct
v Optimize quarter turns to not updateVBO every render cycle
- BVH? (Bounding Volume Hierarchy data structure)
v Deque for storing all moves
- Key bindings for 6 possible turns
- Add black box to hide the fact that large cube is in fact hollow
- Scramble Cube
- Implement solver
- Implement reader-writer system where solver writes, graphical rendering pulls first for current move
- Use a thread for above?
