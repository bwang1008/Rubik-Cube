This is an outline of implementation details of the entire project.

Inspiration fully from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM2czqavlWM by Code Bullet, but none from its source code.

May 14, 2020
- Used code from Mannequin Project of CS378H Graphics class taught by Etienne Vouga, spring 2020 as starter code
	- this is because setting up OpenGL from scratch is really overbearing just to get the same desired environment/setup
- Camera rotation around a center was already implemented
- cube.h for rendering a cube was already implemented in prior project for Minecraft project
- Skybox with skyblue color already implemented in same prior project 
- First started with a single 1x1x1 cube centered at (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), and camera spun around that

Commit "edges of cube black" - May 15, 2020
- In cube fragment shader, used uv coordinates and a bound to make edges of cube black (0.05 out of width 1)

Commit "Initial design of graphical Rubik's Cube" - May 15, 2020
- Wanted Rubik's Cube to be hollow
	- Video by Code Bullet showed brief instances of its source code (Processing 3.0), he used a 3D array
	- I personally think it's too expensive
- Constant cubeWidth in config.h
- in procedure_geometry.cc, added method create_rubik(), that fills in the appropriate vertices and faces
- First did the 6 "centers" of the Rubik's Cube, the cubies with only 1 face showing
- Then the 12 edges, the cubies showing 2 faces
- Then the 8 corners, the cubies showing 3 faces
- In fragment shader, depending on a value saying where you are in absolute orientation, color it appropriately
- Made front green, top white, right red, left orange, bottom yellow, back blue
- Center is (cubeWidth/2.0, cubeWidth/2.0, cubeWidth/2.0)

Commit "R for Revert to default view" - May 16, 2020
- Rotating cube by right click of mouse was slightly clunky
- Pressing R reverts the camera's up, look, and distance, and reverts the center of the scene

Commit "Brought Cube pointers into main" - May 16, 2020
- Used Cube pointers instead of just regular Cube objects on stack, so I can directly access them in main

Commit "Defined Cube type as which faces are colored" - May 16, 2020
- Used the "type" field of Cube to say which faces of the Cube are colored, based on the bit
- Decided on Front, Right, Top, Bottom, Left, Back, where opposites are placed on opposite sides
- Updated fragment shader to color appropriate colors where bit is 1, and black if bit is 0
- Trial and error to find correct values to pass in for type of cube in initial creation of cubes
- Made separate creation if cubeWidth = 1, since otherwise only three faces are colored, while 3 faces are black

Commit "Setup for rotation quarterturn" - May 16, 2020
- Want to keep vertices fixed, but pass into vertex shader the appropriate transformation matrix for each cube
- I don't think you can pass in a glm::mat4 as an "in" field of vertex shader, so passed in 4 glm::vec4 instead for each column
- Originally put transformation matrix as a field of cube.h; changed my mind later and just made it a vector<glm::mat4> in main
- Before, I used cube_vertex_shader for the sky, but later created separate sky_vertex_shader for sky, since cube_vertex_shader
	was getting changed so much
- cube_vertex_shader now has gl_Position = projection * view * trans * vertex_position, where trans is created from the 4 columns passed in

Commit "setup a bit of main for updating VBO" - May 16, 2020
- Idea is every render iteration of main, you update the transformation matrix appropriately, before sending to vertex shader

Commit "Some quarterturn rotations, but incorrect cubies and speed and no stopping point" - May 17, 2020
- Defined a move (quarter turn) as a glm::vec3 in gui
	- move[0] is which face (0 = Front, 1 = Right, 2 = Top, 3 = Bottom,...)
	- move[1] is which layer in (0 for outermost layer, 1 for one layer in, all the way to cubeWidth-1)
	- move[2] is how many quarter turns (negative for counterclockwise)
- Updating transformation matrix in update_rubik in procedure_generation; also pass in current time
- In update_rubik, we define point P as where center of rotating face is, 
	- point Q is distance 1 away from P in direction of axis
- For each cube, let S be the cube center in world coordinates. Then to select this cube for rotation,
	- vector (P->S) and vector (P->Q) must be perpendicular (dot product 0)
- If cube is selected, do newTransformation = (little bit of rotation)  * originalTransformation (initially identity matrix)
- Be careful if theta to make (little bit of rotation) should be positive or negative, since general rotation matrix
	-  is counterclockwise while we want clockwise quarter turns
- Actual result had cubies wrong, because of
- Be careful that since no geometry shader (could not get it to work), data must be repeated 8 times, one for each vertex
- But some rotation was happening (rotating forever)

Commit "Fixed graphical quarter-turns with currentMove" - May 17, 2020
- Moved entire cube so that center of scene is (0, 0, 0), rather than (cubeWidth/2, cubeWidth/2, cubeWidth/2)
	- This is so rotations are only about the x/y/z-axis, which is definitely nicer
- Fixed the wrong cubies by repeatedly adding the transformation matrix in vector 8 times

Commit "Edge cubies now only have 2 faces colored" - May 17, 2020
- Before, only center cubies (cubies with only 1 face showing) had black faces on the other 5
- Trial and error to find the right cube_type to assign to the edges so that they are black

Commit "Made corner cubies only have 3 colored faces" - May 17, 2020
- Also trial and error to find the right cube_type to assign corners so that exactly 3 faces are colored
- This is where I had a separate if statement for if cubeWidth = 1 (otherwise, 3 faces of the 1 cubie are black)
- The whole point of making the inside of the cube black is to give the illusion that the cube is solid
	- Appears that the Rubik's cube inside is made of black cubes
	- Illusion is broken on big cubes, when rotating an inside layer shows it's only rotating the edge
	- Looks like a ring is being rotated rather than a solid slice of the cube

Commit "Fixed transparent black faces" - May 17, 2020
- When turning, sometimes individual black faces are weird because you can see through them
- Simple fix by making fragment_color[3] = 1.0 (nontransparent) in the cube fragment shader

Commit "Restructured quarter turns for optimization; now no looping through every cube every iteration of rendering" - May 17, 2020
- Was too slow. When cubeWidth = 100, using WASD to pan in and out had very noticeable lag
	- Could hold W to zoom in for 5 seconds, and after letting go, you would still zoom in for a couple more seconds
- This is because each render iteration in main, we recalculate which cubes should be selected to rotate, then update
- Idea now is: in render while loop in main, we have

if(gui.isCurrentlyTurning()) {
	// don't do much, maybe update a theta for rotation

	if we turn too much, stop the rotation
}
else {
	set startTime = 0
	select the right cubes to turn
	updateVBO of cube_is_rotating
	turn cubes according to (currentTime - startTime)
	gui.isCurrentlyTurning = true
}

- This way, we avoid recalculating which cubes are selected
- update_rubik now fills a std::vector<int>, where 1 means is currently turning, 0 for not turning, using the dot product = 0 method
- repeat each 1 / 0,  8 times (for each vertex)
- make uniforms to pass in a) the current face that is rotating, and b) the time (current - start) as a theta (also negative for clockwise rotation)
- now instead of creating the matrix transformation in update_rubik, matrix is created instead in the cube vertex shader, on the fly

Commit "Fixed time, removed now-redundant columns for vertex shader" - May 17, 2020
- Removed trans, the vector<mat4> for transformation matrices (since now in vertex shader instead)
- Put gui.setStartTime appropriately so that at the start of rotating, time is (close to) 0 and increases

Commit "Special case for N = 1 Rubik's Cube" - May 18, 2020
- When I actually noticed the bug when cubeWidth = 1 (only 3 faces had color, while other 3 were black)

Commit "Added deque for holding all moves" - May 18, 2020
- Want solver to add moves into a deque, while the graphical rendering pulls one out from the front

Commit "does quarter turns in sequence, but wrong cubes selected" - May 19, 2020
- Stops rotation when the angle is large enough
- Updates the cube_centers to the final position after rotating
- Colors mess up, more faces show black

Commit "fixed updating cube_vertices, but now cubies turn inside out and faces turn black" - May 19, 2020
- Fixed a bug where centers of cubes were not properly calculated (reason why cubes disappear)

Commit "Test run on Windows" - May 21, 2020
- Ubuntu computer I was working on, the disk was not working I think. Sth kept messing up
- Running through Windows works fine with CMAKE

Commit "FIXED QUARTER TURNS AND COLORSgit add .!" - May 21, 2020
- Apparently adding "!" in the git commit message does something with the git history
- Redo of how colors are applied onto cube faces
- Changed type: instead of 6 bits used, now use an additional 12 bits
- 4 bits for front axis, 4 bits for right axis, 4 bits for top axis
- final 6 bits used for saying which face should be colored 
	- relative orientation, like saying oh this cube's front face should be colored
	- irrespective of how it's actual orientation (doesn't matter if it's front face is facing +Y or -Z or sth)
- the 4 bits: front axis means like the vector from cube center to cube's actual front face is <0, 0, -1>,
	- so we use 1 bit for sign, and 3 bits for the vector: <0, 0, -1> becomes 1 001
- cumbersome, lots of code to convert bits to actual matrix
- after finishing rotating a quarter turn, multiply the final transformation matrix by these 3 axes vectors
	- to change the vectors: originally cube was oriented this way; after this quarter turn, now oriented this way
- updateVBO of cube_types
- rebuild axes in cube fragment shader, and knowing where fragment is located (like in +Y direction),
	- I compare with the axes, and then I know oh this fragment is the cube's left,
	- and I know the left of cubes are always orange, so I color it orange

Commit "Removed some print statements, but quarter turns workgit add .!" - May 21, 2020
- Removed some print statements, since they were significantly slowing down the program for cubeWidth = 100

Commit "Fixed idle state when no quarter turns, and confirmed all possible quarter rotations change faces as intended" - May 22, 2020
- Added key-bindings to manually turn the outer faces, except for Down face, since that would be for key D, but D is used to pan right
- Got counter-clockwise rotation when desired
- Small fixes to which matrix is assigned after a rotation finishes
- Small change to what happens when cube idle state

Commit "Added scrambling of graphical cube" - May 25, 2020
- GUI method to add moves to the deque allMoves to get random moves

Commit "Made sky white, edited around to remove warnings" - May 26, 2020
- Background white (but sky position still not fixed)
- Minor edits, mostly casting of doubles to floats, to get rid of compiler warnings
- Added idea to TODO.txt: solve cube by solving individual 3x3x3 cubes with appropriate faces, and recurse out
	- Every 3x3 block of stickers on a face, when solved, looks like a single sticker
	- Like Mergesort kind of Divide & Conquer: solve smaller versions first (3x3x3)
	- When cube length not multiple of 3, like 11, solve the first 9 to get [3 3 3 2] where the last 2 is unsolved
	- Then split into [8 3] so that first 8 are solved, and use last 3 as a 3x3x3 Rubik's cube

Commit "Setup files and some methods for internal solver" - May 29, 2020
- Above idea does not work
	- Implicit assumption that stickers were already in some nice configuration to be able to solve in 3x3x3
- Need an internal representation of where stickers are that code can access (cannot directly access from graphical cube)
- Started on making black triangles to complete illusion that cube is solid, not hollow
- Added solver.h, solver.cc
- Use 6 NxN int[][] as internal representation, with 0,1,2,3,4,5 = green, red, white, yellow, orange, blue
	- Colors correspond with solved cube's front, right, up, down, left, back
- Method copyStickers() is used to get the stickers from cube_centers and cube_types; only called once after scrambling cube

Commit "Copying stickers from the graphical representation to the internal representation works accurately" - May 29, 2020
- Incorporated Solver object into main
- Changed colors of green and orange to distinguish them faster
	- My friend claims the colors are closer together now...
- Renamed copyStickers() to copyConfiguration()
	- No particular reason why
- Added print() to Solver to show all 6 faces' colors
- Minor bug fixes

Commit "Internal representation can now turn front, back, and right" - May 28, 2020
- Those 6 NxN int[][] for sticker colors, can now do turnFront(), turnBack(), turnRight()
- Parameters are int layer, like how many layers in from the face you want to turn
- Then int qts, how many quarter turns clockwise you want

Commit "Internal representation rotation of left, up, down working correctly" - May 29, 2020
- Can now do turnLeft, turnUp(), turnDown()
- Need to write to allMoves and have a structured state so that there is pause between scrambling and solving
- Then we are ready to do actual solving!

Commit "Solving bottom center is almost complete" - May 30, 2020
- Added deque pointer to Solver to access allMoves
- In main, have user press ENTER to go to next section (scrambling -> solve first center -> ...)
- Can set rotation speed (before program is run)
- Function exec() as wrapper function for turnLeft, turnFront,...
- added solveCenter0() to begin solving the bottom layer (yellow when N is even)

Commit "Yellow face center almost complete" - May 31, 2020
- Completed solveCenter0(), some bug fixes

Commit "Bottom center face solved" - June 1, 2020
- Added a while loop, so that the random pieces that get thrown around get solved in the next iteration

Commit "Up center solved as well" - June 1, 2020
- Used a lot of the same code to get the Up face center to be solved as well
- Problematic when N is odd: first pass, solve all columns but the middle one
	 - then rotate Up face sideways, so all but middle row is solved
	 - second pass, solve all columns but the middle one

Commit "Down, Up, LBack, Left centers are solved" - June 2, 2020
- Used a lot of the same code to get the Back center
	- use rows from back and bring to front to fill in with stickers
- Same with Left center

Commit "All centers solved" - June 5, 2020
- Credits to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UnzSSNxcRc - JRCuber
- Swapping method to switch incorrect stickers

Commit "Solved 4 edges; removed Cube pointers" - June 9, 2020
- Made animation window slightly bigger
- Removed Cube pointers in main, as they were unused
- Found rotating speed about 200.0 just about the limit of how fast the rendering is
- Solves first 4 out of 12 edges of the Rubik's cube, puts them onto Up face when finished

Commit "8 edges finished" - June 15, 2020
- Changed solveEdges() into 3 different methods, one for each set of 4
- Middle 4 edges were done by hand on paper to ensure other edges did not change locations
- After solving the middle 4 edges, place them onto the Down face

Commit "Fixed corner case of solving Left center on odd sized cubes that first showed up for N = 15" - June 16, 2020
- Found a bug when N = 15, that results in the Left center not completing the second pass of the middle column
- Thought I fixed it when I restricted taking pieces from Left piece only when numTimes = 0
- Actually not true, when you bring the row out, might have put some desired stickers back into the vacant row
- Handled in the beginning that rotates the desired piece out of the way of the corner case

Commit "All edges finished!" - June 17, 2020
- Made some changes to GUI, including having a total count of moves and quarter turns
- Made a const bool OPTIMIZE, where calling exec will check with the last previous exec and check if cancellation occurs
- For last 4 edges, used flipping algorithm as specificed by https://ruwix.com/twisty-puzzles/big-cubes-nxnxn-solution/
	- This flips the edge between front and right
- Last edge flips pieces around on the same row using the "Red Bull" algorithm, learned from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knMCvKdJFgk

Commit "Built complete bottom face" - June 19, 2020 (right past midnight of June 18)
- Comments on #include statements to say what the include was for
- Begin solving like 3x3x3
	- Need careful handling to be able to solve 2x2x2 Rubik's cube
- 24 if statements, for the 12 different locations of the desired edge and 2 orientations each to make the cross on bottom
- 12 if statements, for the 4 different locations of desired corner on bottom face, and 3 orientations each to fill in bottom corners
- Used while loop to rotate top to find the desired corner if it is not on the bottom face, and 3 more if statements

Commit "Middle layer finished" - June 22, 2020
- Completed the middle layer by placing the appropriate edges into the edges not on Up/Down faces
	- Only the Up layer is left to solve
- Fixed a few bugs

Commit "Last cross finished" - June 22, 2020
- Increased zoom speed for larger cubes
- Orients all 4 Up edges so that the colors on top are correct, not worrying about the colors on the side
- Then permute these edges so that the colors on the sides of these Up edges (Front/Right/Back/Up) are correct

Commit "Found bug where Rubik's cube is in impossible state" - June 22, 2020
- Permuted the position of the corners so that the corners are in the right place, just perhaps not oriented right
- When cubeWidth is even, sometimes freezes - seems as if it reached a state where no amount of rotations can fix/solve the cube

Commit "Fixed parity issues of even sized cubes" - July 2, 2020
- Attempt at implementing pausing cube rotating
- Issue with impossible state is that for even sized cubes, we do not know whether the edge we are solving is oriented correctly or backwards
- Occurs either at a) needing to flip orientation of individual edges, b) swapping corners
- Now whole cube is almost solved, except for the 4 remaining corner pieces

Commit "Fixed another parity issue, RUBIK'S CUBE SOLVED!" - July 3, 2020
- Since there 24 permutations of the positions of the last 4 corners, used 24 if statements to solve each case
	- this handles parity issues with corners
- Also solved the orientations of the 4 corners after placing in right position
- Rubik's cube solved for all sizes!

Commit "Trying out textures, fixed pixel color bug" - July 8, 2020
- Removed some redundancy in solving last 2 centers
	- Have some ideas on extending it to all centers so that each mismatch takes only 2 quarter turns to place correctly
	- along with some + kN where k is a constant
- Used main to instead try loading a JPEG as a texture
- Seems spliced, where a triangle is cut off on the side and pasted on the other side, making picture look cut in half and lopsided

Commit "Flipped some vertices of cube" - July 9, 2020
- Many of the large commit differences came from Visual Studio complaining that line endings were not consistent
- Fixed earlier bug: some how, in the way it reads or applies textures, it wants the width of the JPEG to be divisible by 4.
	- Maybe it reads ints, which are 4 bytes?
	- That means I just pad in some extra bytes at the end of each line until the width in bytes is divisible by 4

Commit "Loaded 6 different textures" - July 9, 2020
- Currently randomgly picking among the 6 colors and filling in a texture with these pixels
- But all 6 faces show the same texture
- Fixed by making 6 textures total, making the appropriate uniforms pointing to the location (0-5)
	- and using glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0) through glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE5)
	- Also need to update textures through each while loop...potentially a bottleneck?
- Can now successfully render a N = 1024 Rubik's cube (or at least the same size and same number of stickers)

Commit "Redid centers of Down and Back", "Redid Left Center" - July 13, 2020
- Use swapping method used on the last two centers, to get stickers for Down from Front, Left, Right, Back
	- Be sure to only use 2 quarter turns per mismatch, plus some linear amount of quarter turns
- Use swapping method to get Back stickers from Left, Right, Up, and be careful getting from Front

Commit "Added rudimentary progress bar" - July 13, 2020
- Used "\r" to bring cursor back to start of line

Commit "Fixed one bug in solving first cross" - July 13, 2020
- Accidentally had a negative sign

Commit "Fixed bug with permuting last corners" - July 13, 2020
- Messed up diagram done on paper

Commit "Added preliminary for speed up" - July 22, 2020
- Found how to change background color using glClearColor
- Used glTexSubImage2D for updating texturings for small improvement in performance
- Included worst-case scenario of number of quarter turns on some methods, I think it can be improved down
- Preliminary solves most of Back by the freedom of the Front,Right,Back,Left faces
	- Use only 1 quarter-turn per mismatch, plus some linear terms
- Same preliminary for solving Back face, except we place Back face in the position of Up face
- Same freedom for solving Left face, though space is much more limited
- Bring the Back stickers on Up onto Back face

Commit "Edges are faster" - July 28, 2020
- Idea to possibly use Bounded Buffer to manage solving while rendering
- Removed GUI::scrambleCube() into Solver::scrambleCube()
- Edges: before, I used to solve each cubie one by one
- Now if several cubies on the current edge being solved are in the same position, then we move those together.
	- For instance, if two correct cubies are next to each other, then both get solved simultaneously
- Be careful on the flipping cubies on the current edge as well as last 4 edges, since might push some cubies incorrectly
- Significant speed up on edge solving on N = 100

Commit "Cleaned up code, comments, READEME, Log, TODO" - July 28, 2020
- Got rid of much of the original solving code that was too inefficient
- Deleted print statements and unnecessary comments

Commit "Removed copyConfiguration after scrambling" - July 29, 2020
- Since the scrambleCube method was moved to solver, no longer need external method to copy graphical cube to internal cube

Commit "Multi-layer turn implemented" - August 5, 2020
- Disorganized code to peek the next turn; if it's parallel to first turn and turning same amount, then move both together
- Now with multi-layer turn, N = 100 takes 27 minutes

Commit "Fixed bugs with odd sized cubes" - August 13, 2020
- Got rid of code that originally drew a skybox; made irrelevant by finding how to color background
- for odd cubes, make sure back center is actually the one we are solving

Commit "Added Ubuntu requirements" - September 15, 2020
- Classes started, so I got busy
- Wanted to try loading this project back on Ubuntu machine again that was wiped
- Added the 4 requirements from Professor Vouga's website.

Commit "Included libjpeg-dev as dependency for Ubuntu" - September 15, 2020
- Program complained that "Could NOT find JPEG (missing: JPEG_LIBRARY JPEG_INCLUDE_DIR)"
- solved with "apt-get install libjpeg-dev". 

Commit "trying out branch" - September 16, 2020
- Wanted to experiment with making a new branch, so as to keep working code
- At the same time, wanted to restructure code to make it neater and continue with textures idea

Commit "Changed solver access for optimization" - September 17, 2020
- In Solver.cc, changed faces[i][j][k] to get(i, j, k) so that I can turning faces become O(N) instead of O(N^2) by keeping track of how many times each face is rotated

Commit "Created reading from json" - September 20, 2020
- Created handle_json.cc to read in json file
- Created example JSON file

Commit "Just checking" - September 24, 2020
- Pass in json path as argument
- Added create_textures2 in main.cc
	- Couldn't put it in procedure_geometry.cc because it could not find Image

Commit "Just to save" - October 4, 2020
- Changed example JSON file because I made a typo, so had to find another example scrambled 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube
- Continued working on reading in JSON

Commit "Did more of reading JSON" - October 4, 2020
- Read in corners
- Find opposite color pairs
- Map symbols to ints that preserve these opposite pairs
- Read in the 6 colors that correspond to each symbol

Commit "Updated Log" - October 9, 2020
- Added more commit messages here
